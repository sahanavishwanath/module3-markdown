# Exercise-3

In the space below, provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

- A _heading_ with the name of the command;
- An example of how it can be used (formatted as a code block);
- A _list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used).

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly. See `complete` branch for an example.

# mkdir
The `mkdir` command can be used to create a new directory or folder. For example:

```
mkdir pics-of-puppies
```
Here's some more information about the 'mkdir' command:
* You can create multiple directories at once: `mkdir pics-of-puppies pics-of-kittens pics-of-bunnies`
* It can be used to create intermediate directories for a new directory: `mkdir -p US/Washington/Seattle`
